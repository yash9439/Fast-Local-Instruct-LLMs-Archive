# Model Repository

Welcome to the Model Repository! This repository contains six Jupyter notebooks, each corresponding to a different language model. These models have been trained and fine-tuned for specific tasks and domains. The models included in this repository are as follows:

1. **Falcon_7B_H20 model**: This notebook contains the implementation and usage instructions for the Falcon_7B_H20 model (7B Parameters). It is a powerful language model designed for natural language processing tasks.

2. **Falcon_7b_4bit_Quantization model**: Here, you will find the Falcon_7b_4bit_Quantization model (7B Parameters) notebook. This model has been quantized to 4 bits, allowing for more efficient memory usage and faster inference times.

3. **DataBrick_Dolly_v2_3B model**: The DataBrick_Dolly_v2_3B model (3B Parameters) notebook provides details on how to utilize this language model, specifically trained for tasks related to NLP Task like Question Answering and Summarization.

4. **GPT_Medium model**: This notebook focuses on the GPT_Medium model. It is a medium-sized (330 M parameter) language model suitable for a wide range of natural language processing tasks.

5. **Facebook_OPT_1.3B model**: The Facebook_OPT_1.3B model (1.3B Parameters) notebook contains instructions on using this model developed by Facebook. It excels in tasks such as sentiment analysis, text generation, and question answering.

6. **Facebook_Open_Llama_3B model**: Finally, we have the Facebook_Open_Llama_3B model (3B Parameters) notebook. It showcases the capabilities of this model, which has been trained to handle a variety of natural language processing tasks.

## How to Use

To make the most of this repository, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired model's notebook. For example, if you want to work with the Falcon_7B_H20 model, open the `Falcon_7B_H20.ipynb` notebook.


3. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab using the command:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   or
   ```
   jupyter lab
   ```

4. Open the selected model's notebook (`Falcon_7B_H20.ipynb`, `Falcon_7b_4bit_Quantization.ipynb`, etc.) within the Jupyter environment.

5. Follow the instructions and code examples provided in the notebook to utilize the corresponding model for your desired natural language processing tasks.
